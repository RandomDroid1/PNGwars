    player "It's not a super long game yet, but it's coming together."
    player "I hope you enjoyed it so far though. This is an insanely early access build since I want to apply for a travel grant and use this as an example"
    player "Have a good day, and please return to this game one day since hopefully it will continue beyond this point. (especially since I'm still going for more artifacts in the Athena Award)"
