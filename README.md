Hi! <br />
This is PNGWARS. It's my first venture into basically any type of game development (aside from a few tiny scratch games), as well as one of my very early ventures into writing a story. <br /><br />
PNGWARS was made after I saw a stock image of a guy holding a gun to a computer (Specifically this one: shutterstock.com/image-photo/businessman-shooting-his-laptop-computer-handgun-9139858) and the scene of someone walking into an office in a game and just observing that happening populated in my mind so I started trying to figure out how that could happen.<br /> <br />
PNGWARS is a fairly short (currently) and extremely unfinished game about diplomacy, and trying to make deals among people who sometimes have little respect for you, and all of them have their own agendas to push.<br /> <br />
I really can't overstate how short the game is. It was made using Ren.PY, which I hadn't even heard of before this so I went in totally blind.<br /> <br />
There was a lot I struggled with developing this. Primarily learning a new programming language, which made things take a very long time. I spent so many hours on the notebook page, and it looks so cool and works now, but it took forever. I learned so much from this project though, Ren.PY seems like an versatile program, and some of the skills I've learned from it might transfer to python (?) <br /> <br />
