(ATHENA BADGE GOES HERE)
Hi! 
This is PNGWARS. It's my first venture into basically any type of game development (aside from a few tiny scratch games), as well as one of my very early ventures into writing a story.
PNGWARS was developed as part of the Athena Award Challenge, which was hosted and funded by the non-profit "Hack Club". If you haven't looked into Hack Club before, and are under 19, please go look into them soon. ()
PNGWARS is a fairly short (currently) and extremely unfinished game about diplomacy, and trying to make deals among people who sometimes have little respect for you, and all of them have their own agendas to push.
The game has some features I see as awesome (I love the notebook page so much, I dedicated so much time to it and it turned out actually perfect man oh my god)
