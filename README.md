Hello! This is my first venture into using Ren.py as a game engine. It was very difficult.
This game can be downloaded at itch.io at this link: https://randomdroids.itch.io/pngwarsv1
PNGWARS was made for the Athena Award (i'll get the link for that badge thing when I submit it fr fr). It is the first time I have done game development, period (not just ren.py). So I went in with no idea of what was possible and what wasn't. I spent a lot of time just throwing myself at an issue until the code did what I want it to,
and for a lot of the code that approach worked eventually (except for the dastardly notebook page, I seriously spent hours on that thing and made 0 headway)
